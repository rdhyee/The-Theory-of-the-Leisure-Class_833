description: "The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions (1899),\
  \ by Thorstein Veblen, is a treatise on economics and a detailed, social critique\
  \ of conspicuous consumption, as a function of social class and of consumerism,\
  \ derived from the social stratification of people and the division of labour, which\
  \ are the social institutions of the feudal period (9th – 15th centuries) that have\
  \ continued to the modern era.\nThat the contemporary lords of the manor, the businessmen\
  \ who own the means of production, have employed themselves in the economically\
  \ unproductive practices of conspicuous consumption and conspicuous leisure, which\
  \ are useless activities that contribute neither to the economy nor to the material\
  \ production of the useful goods and services required for the functioning of society;\
  \ while it is the middle class and the working class who are usefully employed in\
  \ the industrialised, productive occupations that support the whole of society.\n\
  Conducted in the late 19th century, Veblen’s socio-economic analyses of the business\
  \ cycles and the consequent price politics of the U.S. economy, and of the emergent\
  \ division of labour, by technocratic speciality — scientist, engineer, technologist,\
  \ et al. — proved to be accurate, sociological predictions of the economic structure\
  \ of an industrial society.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
